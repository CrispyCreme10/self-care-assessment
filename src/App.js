        <p>In this assessment you will think about how frequently, or how well, you are performing different  self-care activities. The goal of this assessment is to help you learn about your self-care needs  by spotting patterns and recognizing areas of your life that need more attention.</p>
        <p>There are no right or wrong answers on this assessment. There may be activities that you have  no interest in, and other activities may not be included. This list is not comprehensive, but serves  as a starting point for thinking about your self-care needs.</p>
